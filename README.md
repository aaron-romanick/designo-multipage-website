<a name="what-i-learned"></a>### What I learned

Since this was a static site but with a lot of reused elements, I wanted to use something that would let me reuse components but didn't involve a full-blown JavaScript framework. I went with `Astro` as it doesn't require JavaScript to run but it still provides easy access to it when it it needed.

I wanted to add some multilingual functionality, but it was difficult to fit it in with the present design. Thankfully, Astro docs come with some great i18n documentation, and I was able to put something together that I thought was reasonable. The content is stored in easily edittable YAML files so updates can be made quickly.
